# Rotary-Inverted-Pendulum

## project description
We apply LQR control to a Rotary Inverted Pendulum system.

## File description
1. The main source code is "scfinal".
Running this file in MATLAB can generate all result plots.

2. All the MATLAB figure files can be generated by the source code. They are supposed to be open in MATLAB.

## how code was developed (scfinal):
### First: A, B, C, D
The dynamics of this system can be expressed in state space form, which is characterized by A, B, C, D.
### Then: LQR
Then we set some LQR parameters Q and R, applying Ac to control this system
### *first *second *third corresponds to three conditions


## install and run
Download the scfinal.mlx file and run it inside MATLAB.
