## Project description
LQR control is applied to a Rotary Inverted Pendulum system to see how large the applied torque is during the balancing process, as well as the motion states(the angular position, angular speed).

## File description
1. The main source code is "scfinal".
Running this file in MATLAB can generate all result plots.

2. All the MATLAB figure files can be generated by the source code. They are supposed to be open in MATLAB.

## How code was developed (scfinal):
### First: A, B, C, D
The dynamics of this system can be expressed in state space form, which is characterized by A, B, C, D.
### Then: LQR
Then we set some LQR parameters Q and R, applying Ac to control this system
### Notations 
*first *second *third correspond to three conditions


## Install and run
Download the scfinal.mlx file and run it inside MATLAB.
